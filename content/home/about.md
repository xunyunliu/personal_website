# Biography

In July 2018, I completed my PhD study at the [Cloud Computing and Distributed Systems (CLOUDS) Laboratory](http://www.cloudbus.org/), the University of Melbourne, where my research was supervised by Professor [Rajkumar Buyya](http://buyya.com/), Assoc. Prof. [Benjamin Rubinstein](http://www.bipr.net/) and Dr. [Rodrigo N. Calheiros](https://www.westernsydney.edu.au/staff_profiles/uws_profiles/doctor_rodrigo_neves_calheiros). My interests mainly reside in robust resource management and task scheduling, aiming to improve the performance and reliability aspects of distributed stream processing systems. Areas with my involvement include application profiling, performance modeling, SLA-aware application deployment, and light-weight fault tolerance mechanisms. My PhD thesis [Robust Resource Management in Distributed Stream Processing Systems](https://minerva-access.unimelb.edu.au/bitstream/handle/11343/213941/thesis.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y) has passed the examination process, but any valuable comments and suggestions are still welcome.
