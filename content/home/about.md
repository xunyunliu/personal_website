# Biography

I obtained my PhD in computing and information systems from the University of Melbourne, where my research was supervised by Professor [Rajkumar Buyya](http://buyya.com/), A/Prof. [Benjamin Rubinstein](http://www.bipr.net/) and Dr. [Rodrigo N. Calheiros](https://www.westernsydney.edu.au/staff_profiles/uws_profiles/doctor_rodrigo_neves_calheiros). My interests mainly reside in robust resource management and task scheduling of distributed systems, with a focus on improving the performance and reliability of real-time stream processing on cloud. I have been involved in various research areas such as application profiling, performance modeling, SLA-aware application deployment, and light-weight fault tolerance mechanisms.
